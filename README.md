### Universities' World Ranking
This project is for April 2024 which published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/soroushesnaashari/universities-world-ranking) in October 2024 and now I decided to add it on my GitHub account too.

### Overview
In this project which is a simple data analytic project I tried to do my best to find the relations and correlations between different columns and also illustrate the most influential countries arround the world in advancing science.
Maybe in the future I tried to implement an appropriate algorithm to model it.
